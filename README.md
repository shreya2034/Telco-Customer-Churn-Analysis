# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project provides an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, using Python and Jupyter Notebook to uncover key factors that contribute to customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The goal is to analyze which customer segments are most likely to churn and provide actionable insights to help reduce churn rates and improve retention strategies.

The analysis explores demographics, service usage, contract types, payment methods, and value-added services to highlight critical factors influencing customer decisions.


## üîç Key Insights:

- **Total Customers:** 7,043 customers
- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.5% (approx. 1 in 4 customers left the service)
- **Contract Type Impact:**
  - Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn.
  - Two-year contracts show the lowest churn.
- **Payment Method Analysis:**
  - Customers paying via **Electronic Check** churn more.
  - **Auto-payment methods (Credit Card/Bank Transfer)** have significantly lower churn.
- **Service Utilization:**
  - Customers who **do not subscribe** to services like Tech Support, Online Backup, or Security are more likely to churn.
- **Demographics & Behavior:**
  - **Senior citizens**, customers **without partners or dependents**, and **new users** (tenure < 1 year) churn at higher rates.
  - Customers with **high monthly charges** are also at higher risk.
- **Internet Service Impact:**
  - **Fiber Optic** internet users have the highest churn rate among internet users.
